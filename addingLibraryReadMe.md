What are Libraries?

Libraries are a collection of code that makes it easy for you to connect to a sensor, display, module, etc. For example, our PulseSensor Library is a collection of code and projects to get the most out of your PulseSensor.

To use a Library you need to install it.  Inside of the Arduino software, to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`

	(**NOTE** If you do not have Arduino, you can download it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software))


3. Search for and Select  `"PulseSensor.com`

How to Install a Library

Using the Library Manager

To install a new library into your Arduino IDE you can use the Library Manager (available from IDE version 1.6.2). Open the IDE and click to the "Sketch" menu and then Include Library > Manage Libraries.


Then the library manager will open and you will find a list of libraries that are already installed or ready for installation. In this example we will install the Bridge library. Scroll the list to find it, then select the version of the library you want to install. Sometimes only one version of the library is available. If the version selection menu does not appear, don't worry: it is normal.


Finally click on install and wait for the IDE to install the new library. Downloading may take time depending on your connection speed. Once it has finished, an Installed tag should appear next to the Bridge library. You can close the library manager.
